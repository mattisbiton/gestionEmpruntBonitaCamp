## Case study

### Context

After the Covid crisis, application processing time increased, resulting in the need for an internal the need for an internal business process review. It was agreed that some applications can be processed internally and others can be and others can go through external institutions to approve the loan request.

### Need

The company now needs a tool that provides visibility into the entire process, the tasks in progress as well as those that are in error and especially to have the hand on the tasks which are assigned to other organizations and that are awaiting processing.

### Goal

The development of an application accessible from a computer. Allowing the processing of loan applications within a financial/banking institution and giving a synthetic vision of each file. With the help of this decision tool, the financial advisor must be able to withdraw whether or not a loan is granted to a client. This decision is made with the help of several documents provided by the loan applicants that have been previously processed to processed to determine the creditworthiness of each applicant.

## Our requirements

In order to apply for a loan, a client must meet the eligibility requirements of eligibility. To apply for a loan you must meet the criteria of our financial institution financial institution:

### Have a fixed and regular income

It is necessary to show financial stability, a permanent contract or a job in the public service are assets. For the self-employed, company managers and professionals, seniority will be taken into account. Fixed-term contracts, temporary contracts or internships are generally not taken into consideration.)

### Have a low debt ratio

The debt ratio is the ratio between the net income of the household and the total monthly credit payments. It is calculated as follows: Debt ratio = (Total monthly payments X 100) / net salary Example for a person with a net salary of 1500€ and 300€ of monthly loan: (300x100)/1500=20% In France.

### Be under 65 years old and over 25 years old

It would be possible to have a loan if the client is under 65 years old with draconian conditions because the cost of the insurance is very high. Also before 25 years old it would be difficult to get a credit, even a consumer loan.

### A healthy financial situation

After an appointment with a financial advisor, if the client meets all the prerequisites, he or she must provide the prerequisites he must necessarily provide supporting documents:
- A valid identity document
- A proof of address
- A proof of income (last tax notice and, at your choice, last salary or pension statement, or last certificate of family benefits)
- A bank or postal identification statement
- The client who has all these elements can use our application to make his request.
